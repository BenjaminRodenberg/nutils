Changelog
=========

Nutils is under active development and the API is not frozen. Active
users are advised to keep an eye on this file to stay up to date with
the most prominent user-facing changes.


Changed: renamed mesh.gmesh to mesh.gmsh; added support for periodicy

  The gmsh importer was unintentionally misnamed as gmesh; this has been
  fixed. With that the old name is deprecated and will be removed in
  future. In addition, support for the non-physical mesh format and
  externally supplied boundary labels has been removed (see the unit
  test tests/mesh.py for examples of valid .geo format). Support is
  added for periodicity and interface groups.


Changed: function.Inflate, function.DofMap; removed IntVector

  The Inflate class takes a new length argument for the inflated shape.
  The dofmap argument is now a generic int-array function, which removes
  the need for a separate IntVector object; DofMap now derives directly
  from Array.


Changed: renamed ElemFunc to LocalCoords

  Besides the name change the new object is derived from
  DerivativeTargetBase so that it can be used as a derivate target,
  removing the need for a 'localcoords' special token.


Changed: function.asarray

  Formerly asarray returned non-evaluable objects as numpy arrays. The
  new implementation always returns a nutils Array, wrapping constant
  objects in function.Constant.


New: function.Constant

  Wrapper object that returns a numpy array through evalf, introducing a
  singleton point axis at location 0.


New: function.Array with dtype; deprecates function.ArrayFunc

  ArrayFunc is deprecated and will be removed. The new Array base class
  is identical to ArrayFunc except for the mandatory argument 'dtype',
  which takes a value of float, int, or bool.
