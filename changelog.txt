Finity 12.12.19 --- major enhancements

Fixed:

* Sparse matrix in place addition: gave erroneous results.
* Function spaces now support polynomial degree=1.

New:

Fine grained modules. Contents of util are distributed over util,
core, numeric. Core contains components that do not depend on any
other finity modules. Numeric hosts numpy operations and acts as an
interace for NumpyExtra. Current modules are:

  core      log       parallel
  element   matrix    plot
  function  mesh      topology
  green     numeric   util

Deprecated NumpyExtra. Numeric module now takes c-methods from
_numeric.so in the same directory. Methods in _numeric are stripped
down to the minimum with pre and post processing possibly required in
numeric.py.

Get, GetItem, Align. New ArrayFunc objects replace former GetItem for
indexing one item (a[i]), indexing a slice (a[i:j]), and introducing
new axes (a[_]) and/or reordering axes (a.T), respectively. The reason
is twofold. 1. These three operations are fundamentally different and
interact with matrix operations in different ways. 2. Separating the
operations allows one to push Get towards the branches of the function
tree, reducing work, and Align towards the root, increasing likelyhood
of common subexpressions.

Diagonalize, TakeDiag. New ArrayFunc objects that replace one axis by
the diagonal of two, or vice versa, respectively. The former is
suboptimal, though valid, in actual evaluation, because of the
introduced zeros. Its main purpose is to serve as intermediate
operation that collapses against for instance Get or Dot.

Kronecker. New ArrayFunc object that introduces one axis with one
entry equal to the original array. Like Diagonalize its main purpose
is to serve as intermediary.

Expand. New ArrayFunc object that repeats singleton axes to the actual
shape. Like before its main purpose is to serve as intermediary as
singleton expansion usually obviates the need for explicit repetition.

New rectilinear mesh. New geometry evaluates by direct scaling &
translation of element-local coordinates. Function definition remains
unchanged.

Properties. A non-global mechanism to make parameters available to
funtions without passing them as arguments. Properties are local
variables in a function frame and traced down to first occurrence.
Example:

  from finity import prop

  def main():
    prop.test = 1
    f() #-> prints 2
    g() #-> prints 1
  
  def f():
    prop.test = 2
    g()
  
  def g()
    print prop.test

Default settings. If a file ~/.finityrc exists, util.run will execute
it as a script and copy all resulting globals as properties. Some
properties can alternatively be set by command line switches, which
then override the finityrc defaults. For example, the following
superfluous finityrc sets all recognized properties to their default
values:

  nprocs = 1
  linewidth = 60
  outdir = '~/public_html'
  verbose = 3
  imagetype = 'png'
  dot = 'dot'

Logging. Prioritized output via methods of the new log module, which
behave identical to python3's print function. Use of 'print' is
discouraged. Priority levels are error (4), warning (3), info (2),
progress(1) and debug (0). Levels lower than the 'verbose' property
(.finityrc or --verbose, util.run default 1) are suppressed.

Clean text output. Copy-pasteable script header and command line
arguments. Cleaner html code. Error tracebacks in html output.
Configurable progress bar length via 'linewidth' property (.finityrc
or --verbose, util.run default 60).

Configurable output directory via 'outdir' property (.finityrc
or --outdir, util.run default '~/public_html'). Per-script
subdirectories and 'latest' symlink, plus a global 'latest' symlink in
the usual location. Html output contains a [permlink] to resolve te
link for later use.

Configurable image filetype via 'imagetype' property (.finityrc or
--imagetype, util.run default 'png'). Applies to plot methods and
graphviz.

Graphviz switched off by default, switched on by setting dot
executable path via 'graphviz' property (.finityrc or --graphviz).
Forks for parallel execution. Evaluables define their own
representation, defaulting to their name and static arguments.
Currently Get and Align define alternative representations, while
Diagonalize, Kronecker and Expand flip b/w to warn for potential
sub-optimality.
